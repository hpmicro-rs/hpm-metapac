The register holds the New Data flags of Rx Buffers 32 to 63. The flags are set when the respective Rx Buffer has been updated from a received frame. The flags remain set until the Host clears them. A flag is cleared by writing a ’1’ to the corresponding bit position. Writing a ’0’ has no effect. A hard reset will clear the register. 0= Rx Buffer not updated 1= Rx Buffer updated from new message."]
